Getting Started
Follow the steps below to get started with the project:

Clone this repository or create a folder for your project.
Open the Node.js command prompt and navigate to your project folder using the cd command.
Install Express and handlebars by running the following command in the Node.js command prompt:

Create a JSON file with 4 levels to store customer and order data or any other example.
Define 4 routes to display the customer and order data in HTML format in the app.js file. Use the handlebars template engine to render the HTML pages.
